## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Property managers who own or oversee multiple rental properties often struggle with keeping track of unit availability, tenant information, lease agreements, and maintenance requests. Managing these tasks manually or through disjointed systems leads to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in resolving tenant issues. Tenants also lack a centralized platform to access key apartment details, submit maintenance requests, and track their resolution status.

### Proposed Solution
A streamline platform that provides an all-in-one solution for property managers to efficiently oversee their rental properties. Platform capabilities includes:
- **Real-Time Unit Tracking**: Monitor the status of each property (occupied, available, or under maintenance).
- **Centralized Document Management**: Store and retrieve leases, payment proofs, maintenance records, and other important files.
- **Tenant Portal**: Enable tenants to access apartment rules, emergency contacts, and submit maintenance requests with descriptions and images.
- **Maintenance Request Tracking**: Maintain a transparent timeline for reported issues, status updates, and resolutions.
- **Secure Role-Based Access**: Ensure property managers and tenants have appropriate access through a secure login system.
- **Building-Wide Management**: Provide information on shared spaces, security features, and community updates.
